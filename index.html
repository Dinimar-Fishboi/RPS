        Important things to remember: you can turn ANYTHING into a variable so long
        as you provide a name and assignment.
        <pre>

            var userAnswer = window.prompt("Hi! Want to play?", "R, S or P?",);

        </pre>
        This statement essentially states that the answer that the user puts into the window.prompt 
        so if the user enters <b>"R"</b>, <b>R</b> = userAnswer.
    </p>
    <p>
        The other necessary step in this process was to make the computer randomly generate 
        P, R or S. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So - we made an array of 3 variables by writing the following:
        <pre>
            var possibleAnswers = ["S", "P", "R"] 
        </pre>
        Which longform look like so:
        <pre>
            possibleAnswers[0] // as S
            possibleAnswers[1] // as P
            possibleAnswers[2] // as R
        </pre>
        This means that every potential Random Computer output had an integer value. So then we need an equation
        to generate a random integer of 0, 1 or 2.
    </p>
    <p>
        Which is where the next bit of code comes in:
        <pre>
            function getRandomInt(max) {
                return Math.floor(Math.random() * max);
             } 
        </pre>
        Confession: I have no true understanding of this. I <i>absolutely</i> googled and stole it off the internet.
        Specifically from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random">here.</a>
        What I <i>do</i> get is that (max) specifies the largest, non inclusive integer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Or in this instance - the length of an array...ðŸ˜ˆ
